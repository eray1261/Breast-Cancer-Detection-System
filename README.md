The objective of the WHO Global Breast Cancer Initiative (GBCI) is to reduce global breast cancer mortality by 2.5% per year, thereby averting 2.5 million breast cancer deaths globally between 2020 and 2040. Reducing global breast cancer mortality by 2.5% per year would avert 25% of breast cancer deaths by 2030 and 40% by 2040 among women under 70 years of age. The three pillars toward achieving these objectives are: health promotion for early detection; timely diagnosis; and comprehensive breast cancer management.

However, the awareness regarding breast cancer still seems to be having a setback. According to Google trends, the term ‘breast cancer’ is rarely looked up in USA and gains maximum traction during October every year. A quick analysis showed that the number of searches, though very low, spiked in October as it was breast cancer awareness month.

In 2020, there were 2.3 million women diagnosed with breast cancer and 685 000 deaths globally. As of the end of 2020, there were 7.8 million women alive who were diagnosed with breast cancer in the past 5 years, making it the world’s most prevalent cancer. There are more lost disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by women to breast cancer globally than any other type of cancer.  Breast cancer occurs in every country of the world in women at any age after puberty but with increasing rates in later life.  

Despite of these findings, Google Trends shows that the awareness of breast cancer to any other cancer is comparatively lesser in USA.

Inspired by these findings, I built a Breast Cancer Detection System using machine learning models and predictive analysis.
The data set is available in https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data 
In this detection system, the Random Forest Classifier had maximum accuracy and thus was implemented. 
The other models that were tested were :
1.	Logistic Regression 
2.	Decision Tree Classifier 
3.	Naive Bayes Classifier Training

Moreover, the result were as follows:

Thus the third model, The Random Forrest Classifier was the best model with maximum accuracy.
